-Fetching data through an Http request to an api or web service. using GET.
The GET request will hit the api or web service and fetch from db. It will send
back as a Http response. We get back an observable where the server has to convert
it (cast it) into an array and then can be seen in the component.

-Observables: sequence of items that arrive asynchronously over time
must be converted to the right format to be able to use it in the components through
mapping and subscribing. Those that are subscribed will only get it.
-in an HTTP call, it is a single item and assign the array to a local variable

-RXJS is an external library that allows us to work with observables
